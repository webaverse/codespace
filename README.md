# Webaverse Codespace
Run your own Webaverse on Codespaces

## Quick Start

 - [ ] Open a terminal and do the following:
 
```sh
# You will answer some cert questions
./init.sh

# Then you can either F5 to launch via debugging or
npm start
```

 -  [ ] In the bottom right corner a notification will prompt you with a URL to your Webaverse.

 -  [ ] In the future you only need to `npm start` or [F5]!
